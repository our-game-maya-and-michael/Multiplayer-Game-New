# Multiplayer games using Photon Fusion

We added 2 elements to the game from the lesson. The first is a player with animation, and the second is points that the player gains if he attacks.
Code based on the [Fusion Shared Mode Tutorial](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/tutorials/shared-mode-basics/overview).
